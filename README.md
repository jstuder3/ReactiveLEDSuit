# ReactiveLEDSuit

This repository contains PlatformIO code for a reactive / animated LED suit. It runs on an ESP32 board, and uses two 20W power banks running in parallel sewed into a suit to power all of the LED strips. By connecting accelerometers, the user can make a punch motion and have the suit react to it.
